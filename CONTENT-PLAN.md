# PilatesMallorca.com Content Plan (SEO + AI Search)

Goal: maximize organic traffic for Pilates-related searches in Mallorca and convert visitors into lead submissions (email/WhatsApp) that we match to 3 providers (studios, teachers, retreats).

## Target Keyword Themes (Mallorca)
- Core: pilates mallorca, reformer pilates mallorca, pilates studios mallorca, pilates teachers mallorca, pilates retreats mallorca
- Local intent: pilates palma de mallorca, reformer pilates palma, pilates calvia, pilates alcudia, pilates soller, pilates andratx, “near me”
- High-intent modifiers: private, beginner, prenatal, postnatal, back pain, rehab, athletic, english speaking, german speaking, pricing, timetable
- Comparison intent: reformer vs mat pilates, reformer vs yoga, private vs group, pilates vs strength training
- Tourist intent: “one week”, “short stay”, “hotel”, “morning class”, “weekend retreat”

## Core Conversion Pages (Money Pages)
These pages should link heavily to the FAQ hub + blog clusters and always include a visible match form.
- `/` Home: match form + positioning + trust + “How it works”
- `/signup/` Full intake: most detailed form (for ads + serious intent)
- `/studios/` Studio directory: filters + area pages + match form
- `/teachers/` Teacher directory: match form + specialty routing
- `/retreats/` Retreat directory: match form + area routing

## SEO Authority Pages (E-E-A-T for AI Search)
These pages support “AI answers” credibility and help LLMs cite the site.
- `/faq/` Long-tail FAQ hub (with FAQ schema + internal links)
- `/sources/` Sources library (PubMed/WHO/etc.)
- `/editorial-policy/` Editorial standards and update policy
- `/medical-disclaimer/` Safety + scope clarity
- `/llms.txt` LLM-focused index entry (already present)

## Local SEO Structure (Directory Expansion)
Purpose: rank for “Pilates + area” and “Reformer Pilates + area” searches.
- Studios: `/studios/{area}/` and selective `/studios/{area}/{studio}/` profiles
- Retreats: `/retreats/{area}/` (Palma, Calvia, Tramuntana, Andratx, Alcudia, etc.)
- Teachers: keep `/teachers/` as the hub, add specialization pages like `/teachers/reformer/`

Linking rules:
- Every local page should link to:
  - its parent hub (`/studios/`, `/retreats/`, `/teachers/`)
  - the match form (`/signup/` and/or in-page form)
  - 2-4 relevant blog posts + 1 comparison page

## Blog Clusters (Traffic Engine)
Purpose: capture informational traffic, then convert via contextual CTAs and internal linking.

Cluster hubs (already present) should link to 6-12 supporting posts each:
- Beginner Pilates in Mallorca
- Private Pilates in Mallorca
- Prenatal/Postnatal Pilates in Mallorca
- Athlete/Performance Pilates in Mallorca

Add 4 new cluster hubs (recommended next):
- Pricing + booking in Mallorca
- Injury-aware + back-care Pilates
- Tourist/short-stay Pilates Mallorca
- “English speaking” and multilingual Pilates Mallorca

Each blog post should include:
- a short “answer-first” paragraph (for AI snippets)
- FAQ section (FAQ schema already used site-wide)
- sources section for health claims
- “next step” block linking to relevant conversion pages

## FAQ Expansion Plan (Long-Tail)
Add and maintain 60-120 FAQs. Prioritize:
- location + language (e.g., “English-speaking reformer Pilates in Palma”)
- price + booking logistics
- beginner onboarding, injuries, pregnancy
- comparisons (reformer vs mat/yoga)

## Publishing Cadence (Pragmatic)
- Week 1: finalize conversion pages + FAQ hub + internal linking
- Weeks 2-4: add 2-4 posts/week per cluster until each cluster has 8+ posts
- Ongoing: refresh top 10 pages monthly with new FAQs, sources, and internal links

## Success Metrics
- Organic sessions and impressions (Google Search Console)
- Form conversion rate per core page (Netlify/HubSpot submissions)
- Top keyword coverage (rank tracking)
- Assisted conversions from blog and FAQ pages
